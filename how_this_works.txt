7 SEGMENT DISPLAY INTERFACE
-> Reference 2.10.2 in DE10 Datasheet

Six 7SD's on DE10. Each SD is controlled from
two registers. First 4 7SD's (called HEX0 - HEX3)
are controlled via a register starting at address
0xFF200020. It is a 32-bit, write-only data register.
HEX3 is controlled by (MSB - 1) - 6 bits (i.e., the top 7 bits),
HEX0 is controlled by LSB + 6 bits (i.e., the bottom 7 bits).
The top-most bit in a specific hex control group is 
unused (since it's only got 7 segments).
    
Order is this:
      0
    5   1
      6    
    4   2
      3

How are patterns actually written to the register?

these all have to be 32 bit integers because you can't do
bitwise operations with varying-sized types 
 
the number we are bitshifting is the actual data value in the hex
register. Addressing is of no concern here because we're bitshifting
it by 8 bits (1 byte) every time anyways. No need to change the pointer;
you're just changing the value itself
